// TODO: Step 1 - Create loop and get user guess
// - The loop. It needs to keep looping while the ship isnâ€™t sunk. 

// TODO: Step 2 - Check user guess
// - Get the guess from the user and validate it.
// - Make sure it really is a number between 0 and 6

// TODO: Step 3 - Check if ship has sunk
// - Write the logic to check for a hit on a ship and see if the ship is sunk.

// TODO: Step 4 - Display states to user
// - Create a little report for the user with the number of guesses it took to sink the ship.
